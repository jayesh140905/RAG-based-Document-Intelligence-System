# RAG-based-Document-Intelligence-System

📄 RAG-Based Document Intelligence System

An end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables natural language querying over PDF documents using semantic search and large language models.

This project demonstrates a production-style implementation of document ingestion, embedding generation, vector indexing, and context-aware response generation with a real-time interactive interface.

🚀 Overview

The system allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions in natural language. Instead of relying solely on a language model’s internal knowledge, it retrieves semantically relevant document chunks and uses them as grounded context for generation.

This reduces hallucinations and significantly improves factual accuracy.

🔍 How It Works (Example Flow)

Upload a PDF document.

System extracts text and creates semantic chunks.

Chunks are embedded and indexed using FAISS.

User enters a question.

Top-k relevant chunks are retrieved.

LLM generates a grounded response using retrieved context.

📊 Design Considerations

Reduced hallucination via grounded retrieval

Optimized chunk size vs. retrieval precision trade-off

Separation of retrieval and generation layers

Scalable vector index architecture

Modular codebase for integration with APIs (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.)

🚧 Future Improvements

Re-ranking layer (cross-encoder based)

Hybrid search (BM25 + dense retrieval)

Multi-document memory support

Deployment on GCP / Vertex AI

Gemini API integration

Evaluation metrics (Recall@k, MRR, answer faithfulness scoring)

📌 Why This Project Matters

Modern AI applications increasingly require:

Retrieval grounding

Low-latency vector search

Modular LLM integration

Deployment-ready architecture

This project demonstrates practical understanding of real-world RAG system design beyond tutorial-level implementations.
